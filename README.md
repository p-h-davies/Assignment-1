# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This website was created for Horiseon, which is an SEO company, to act as a website for visitors and potential clients to view and learn about the company and what it does. On the page, there is a main header with navigation options, and then a main content section (including an aside). The first area of content covers 'Search Engine Optimization,' 'Online Reputation Management' and 'Social Media Marketing', whilst the second (aside) area covers benefits, such as 'Lead Generation,' 'Brand Awareness' and 'Cost Management'. Underneath this, there is a footer which states that the page was made by Horiseon and which provides the company's trademark statement.
